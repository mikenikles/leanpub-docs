# How to Contribute

Hi and welcome ðŸ‘‹! Thank you for your interest to contribute.

Please always open an issue before you send a pull request. This helps
with visibility and also makes sure you don't develop features that for
whatever reason may not get merged.

## NPM Scripts

* `build`: Builds the Svelte sidebar and copies the CSS and Javascript
           to the correct location where it gets picked up by the add-on
           code.
* `deploy`: Builds (see above) and deploys the add-on to script.google.com.
